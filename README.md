# ADLplug
Synthesizer plugin for ADLMIDI and OPNMIDI (VST/LV2)

![screenshot](docs/screen.png)

## Introduction

This software package provides FM synthesizer plugins, based on [OPL3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YMF262) and [OPN2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YM2612) sound chip emulations.  
The emulations and the drivers are provided by [libADLMIDI](https://github.com/Wohlstand/libADLMIDI) and [libOPNMIDI](https://github.com/Wohlstand/libOPNMIDI).

- [x] control of multiple YMF262/YM2612 emulated chips
- [x] high fidelity emulation, with choice of compromise level (good fidelity/fast, excellent fidelity/slow)
- [x] synthesis of melodic and percussive instruments
- [x] extensible polyphony
- [x] bundled collection of instruments
- [x] support for dynamic parameterization and automation
- [x] rigorous implementation of the MIDI standard
- [x] multi-channel operation with General MIDI compatibility
- [x] ability to synthesize entire MIDI files out of the box

## Build instructions

Install required dependencies:
- the CMake build system
- a C++11 compiler
- development packages for Linux: Jack, ALSA, Freetype, X11

### Compiling

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jpcima/ADLplug.git
mkdir ADLplug/build
cd ADLplug/build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..  #<more build options...>
cmake --build .
```

This package is able to build several plugins from a single source:
- to build the OPL3 variant, define the option `ADLplug_CHIP` to `OPL3`;
- to build the OPN2 variant, define the option `ADLplug_CHIP` to `OPN2`.

| Build option                                  | Description                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -DADLplug_VST2=ON/OFF                         | Build a VST2 plugin                                             |
| -DADLplug_VST3=ON/OFF                         | Build a VST3 plugin                                             |
| -DADLplug_LV2=ON/OFF                          | Build a LV2 plugin                                              |
| -DADLplug_Standalone=ON/OFF                   | Build a standalone program                                      |
| -DADLplug_Jack=ON/OFF                         | Build a standalone program for Jack with better features        |
| -DADLplug_CHIP=OPL3/OPN2                      | Build a variant for the given chip type (default: OPL3)         |
| -DADLplug_PCH=ON/OFF                          | Use precompiled headers, on a compiler which supports it        |
| -DADLplug_ASSERTIONS=ON/OFF                   | Force building with assertions regardless of build type         |
